                    <h2>What I learned</h2>
                    
                    <p>I learned better how to use localStorage. It's something very interesting and useful. 
                    Information saved in the user's browser via localStorage persists even after the browser 
                    is closed. They are only cleared if the user clears the browser cache. In any browser, 
                    localStorage is limited to storing only 5Mb of data. Much more than the 4Kb of cookies; 
                    Generally used to write public data that does not need to be so permanent as to save 
                    it in the database. It is also worth remembering that it is not good to save sensitive 
                    data for security reasons. You can only use strings in localStorage, so if it's not a 
                    string yet, we can use JSON.stringify() to save the data.</p>

                    <p>If it is necessary to save some user data, but even more temporarily, we can use 
                    sessionStorage. For example, if the user is filling out a form, and he needs to do 
                    something else, but it wouldn't be nice for him to lose everything he's already done, 
                    so we use sessionStorage that keeps the data for the duration of the session, that is, 
                    the data only will be deleted when the user closes the browser. localStorage It is 
                    widely used, for example, to store interface behaviors.</p>

                    <p>*Just a curiosity, you can see what data is saved in localStorage and sessionStorage, 
                    just press ctrl + shift + i or right click and "Inspect" (google chrome), then go to 
                    Application >> Storage and on the left side , you choose the option, localStorage / 
                    sessionStorage</p>

                    <p>The structure of localStorage is very simple, consisting of "key" and "value", 
                        and to work with this data, we basically have 4 methods:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                localStorage.setItem() to create a new key pair: value;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                localStorage.getItem() to retrieve the value of the key:value pair;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                localStorage.removeItem() to remove a specific pair;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                localStorage.clear() clears ALL pairs recorded for that domain;
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Example: localstorage.setItem("myKey", "value");</p>
                        </p>
